# The Forest vertex-cover problem

## Problem statement:

Original problem sounds like: 
    There is connected graph. You can remove vertexes. Which the least set of vertexes you can leave, that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one of remaining vertexes.

    Here we have not a connected graph, we have set of connected graphs (forest)
