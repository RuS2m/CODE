# Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm

## Problem statement:

Finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles)

## Description:

This is the simpliest way to find the shortesr way, and by virtue of simplicity it's complexity equals _O(n^3)_.

The algorithm is just search of all cases and looks like this:
```
for k = 1 to n //search all vertices (k)
    for i = 1 to n //look for each pair of vertices i and j 
        for j = 1 to n //way through the top 
            W[i][j] = min(W[i][j], W[i][k] + W[k][j]) //if it less than original - change.
```
